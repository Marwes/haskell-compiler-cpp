# Haskell Compiler/VM

This is an old experiment I made writing a Haskell compiler in C++ which compiles down to G-Machine code. It implements basic parsing, typechecking and compilation but not much more as it was rewritten and continued in Rust.

## Dependencies

Requires [boost](http://boost.org/) and [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) (for unittesting).
